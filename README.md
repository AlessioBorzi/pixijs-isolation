# pixi-multiplayer-example

Example how to make multiplayer game with pixi.js, node.js.

Also uses [client interpolation](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/entity-interpolation.html) to prevent laggy movement when there are server delays present.

Tried to keep as simple as i could.

To start use `npm install` and then `npm run start`

And then open browser at http://127.0.0.1:3000, you can open the tab multiple times to spawn a new player in the game.
